This is a program to showcase graph algorithms. Specifically it uses Dijkstra's for computing shortest paths and Kruskal's to compute the Minimum spanning tree.
It also can compute the topological sort for an acyclic graph. 
Graphs are read in through a file with this structure:

  # of vertices
  vertex name 
  ...
  # of edges
  FromVertex ToVertex weight
  ...

To run simply compile DisjointSet.cpp Graph.cpp graphRunner.cpp together and then execute
