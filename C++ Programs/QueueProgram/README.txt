This is a progarm using queues. The idea is it is simulating lines at a fast food restaurant. 
It keeps track of two scenarios: one in which there is only one line feeding to 3 registers, 
or where there are 3 lines each feeding into one register. It prints arrival times of customers 
(which are read in from a file) out to a file as well as basic statistics like average wait time,
max wait time, and longest line length.
